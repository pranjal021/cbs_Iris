# Project Name: IRIS

IRIS is a web application which will help students who are new to programming, students who are experts in programming, software developers & specially abled people to code just by conversing with it & IRIS will write the code for them.

### This web application harnesses the power of Artificial Intelligence(AI) and Natural Language Proessing to convert natural language to code. We have used a JavaScript NLP like library Bravey to convert natural language to code just by conversing with the software. 

IRIS will allow newbies to code just by conversing with it because it is difficult for them to write the code. This will help them learn the syntax of two programming languages Javascript & python parallely.  It will also allow them to visualise various algorithms which will help them learn fast. IRIS will also help experts by increasing their speed of programming. They will be able to code faster because they just have to converse with it & hence they will be able to develop the applications faster. IRIS can also be used for sending emails just by speaking. People with injuries to their hands, or muscular dystrophy patients and specially-abled people will find IRIS beneficial because they will just have to converse with it & IRIS will write the code for them.
