## **Pathfinding Visualizer**<br/>
-[https://pathfindingvisulaizer-pranjal-pearl.netlify.app](https://pathfindingvisulaizer-pranjal-pearl.netlify.app)<br>
In this project , there is one start point(green) and one end point (red) . Obstacles (black) can also be added in the grid by clicking on the grid or by dragging over it .
Four ALGORITHMS are implemented for searching the shortest path between starting and ending point . Animation is  used for displaying the path and the nodes which are  visited while searching .The path is shown in yellow color and visited nodes are shown in blue color and the nodes that are visited in the last are shown in green color. 
Time of searching  and length of the path are also shown . 
Three PATTERNS (of obstacles) making algorithms are also implemented :- Stair Pattern , Spiral Pattern and Recursive Division . In  this also animation is added .
Two modes are added to change the THEME :- Dark Mode and Light Mode .
In the Dark Mode star particles are also added which are moving according to the speed given to them .
All the panels like algorithm selection panel , instructions panel , buttons panel are draggable . 
Most compatible with Goggle Chrome , Microsoft Edge
Works fine in mobile also.

### **Meet the Algorithms**<br/>
This application supports the following algorithms:<br/>

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm** (weighted)<br/>
the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path<br/>
- **A'*' Search** (weighted)<br/>
arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm<br/>
- **Breath-first Search** (unweighted)<br/>
a great algorithm; guarantees the shortest path<br/>
- **Best-First Search**<br/>
Best-first search is a search algorithm which explores a graph by expanding the most promising node chosen according to a specified rule.<br/>
